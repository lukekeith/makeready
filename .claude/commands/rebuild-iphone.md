description: Rebuild and launch iPhone app in simulator
---

Rebuild the MakeReady iPhone app and launch it in the iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator.

**Your task:**
1. Build the app using xcodebuild
2. Uninstall the old version from the simulator
3. Install the newly built app
4. Launch the app
5. Report the process ID

**Important:**
- Change to the `/Users/lukekeith/www/makeready/iphone` directory first
- Use the iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator
- Build to `./build` directory
- Report any build errors clearly
- Keep output concise - just show build status and final PID
